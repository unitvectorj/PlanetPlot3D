PlanetPlot3D

Usage tips:

Since the size of the circles (planets) and thickness of the orbital paths do not change when you zoom, you may need to adjust these to get the best looking image for your desired viewing angle and zoom level. Since the radii of Saturn's rings DO scale with zoom while the planet itself does not, you will have to mess with those scales to get it right.

Once the plot is generated, I usually maximize the window.
Click and hold the left mouse button and drag to change the viewing angle.
Click and hold the right mouse button and scroll up and down to zoom.

Once you get it arranged how you like, click the save button. When entering the name put .pdf at the end for a vector graphics file, which is best for printing because you can scale it to any size. Put .png at the end for a regular pixel graphics image.


How I print them:

I found a decent way to make a nice looking glossy 10x8 inch print. I get them printed on poster paper through OfficeDepot. Since their smallest size poster is 20x16 inches, I make 4 images and combine them into a single pdf in Word. Printing 4 images like this is something like $12-15. Then I just cut them apart and put them in simple black frames. It comes out looking pretty good.
